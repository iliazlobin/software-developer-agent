# Software Engineer Agent for Enterprise Development
## Abstract
This project provides an AI software engineer that automates the complete software development lifecycle‚Äîfrom requirements analysis and architecture design to implementation, testing. Powered by LangGraph, it acts as an autonomous development team member, creating production-ready code, comprehensive test suites, and maintaining high software quality standards for enterprise organizations.

## Motivation
Enterprise software development faces unique challenges: complex requirements, strict compliance needs, extensive testing requirements, and the need for maintainable, scalable solutions. Manual development processes are bottlenecks in modern enterprises where speed and quality are both critical. This project solves these challenges by providing an AI agent that can understand business requirements, design appropriate solutions, implement code following enterprise standards, create comprehensive tests, and ensure quality‚Äîall while maintaining the rigor and documentation standards expected in enterprise environments.

## System Design
The diagram below illustrates the end-to-end architecture of the Software Engineer Agent. It shows how the Manager Agent coordinates specialized sub-agents for planning, programming, reviewing, and testing. The system integrates with GitHub for issue tracking and pull requests, uses sandboxed environments for safe code execution, and includes comprehensive testing capabilities via Playwright. State management ensures consistent tracking of tasks, code changes, and quality metrics throughout the development lifecycle.

- üìù **From GitHub**: Start development tasks directly from GitHub issues by adding specific labels:
  - `software-engineer`: Standard development workflow with human review
  - `software-engineer-auto`: Automated development with minimal human intervention
  - `software-engineer-enterprise`: Enhanced workflow with comprehensive testing and compliance

## Testing Status Management

The agent includes sophisticated testing status management that tracks testing progress throughout the development lifecycle:

- **Intelligent Routing**: Testing only occurs when code changes require validation
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive status management (`not_started`, `required`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`)
- **Retry Capability**: Automatic retry of failed tests with error analysis
- **Agent Control**: AI can determine when testing should be skipped or required based on change analysis
